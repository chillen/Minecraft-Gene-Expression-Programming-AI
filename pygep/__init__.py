PyGEP is a simple library suitable for academic study of GEP (Gene 
Expression Programming) in Python 2.5, aiming for ease of use and 
rapid implementation. It provides standard multigenic chromosomes; a 
population class using elitism and fitness scaling for selection;
mutation, crossover and transposition operators; and some standard 
GEP functions and linkers.

This software is released under the GPL 2.0.
